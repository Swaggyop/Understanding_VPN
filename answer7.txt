Research VPN encryption and privacy features -


A Virtual Private Network (VPN) ensures online privacy and security by encrypting your internet traffic and routing it through a secure server. Below are the key encryption techniques and privacy features used by most modern VPNs like ProtonVPN and Windscribe:


🔐 1. Encryption Standards Used in VPNs

🔸 AES-256 Bit Encryption

Most VPNs use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256-bit keys, which is considered military-grade encryption.


It would take billions of years for even supercomputers to crack this encryption by brute force.


It secures data packets so that they can't be read or altered during transmission.



🔸 RSA Encryption

VPNs use RSA (commonly 2048 or 4096-bit) for securely exchanging encryption keys between your device and the VPN server.



🔸 Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

PFS ensures that even if one session key is compromised, past and future sessions remain secure.


It generates a new encryption key for every session.



🔐 2. VPN Protocols That Secure Traffic

VPNs rely on specific protocols to establish secure and stable tunnels. These include:


🔹 OpenVPN

Open-source, highly secure protocol used by ProtonVPN and many others.


Supports both UDP (faster) and TCP (more stable) transport layers.



🔹 WireGuard

A newer, faster protocol with modern cryptography.


Used by ProtonVPN and others for low-latency, high-speed encryption.



🔹 IKEv2/IPSec

Good for mobile devices because it reconnects quickly when switching networks (e.g., from Wi-Fi to mobile data).


Uses strong encryption and is stable over time.



🛡️ 3. Privacy Features in VPNs

✅ IP Address Masking

Hides your real IP and replaces it with one from the VPN server, making you untraceable online.


✅ No-Logs Policy

Trusted VPNs like ProtonVPN and Windscribe have a strict no-logs policy, meaning they do not store user activity or connection logs.


✅ DNS Leak Protection

Prevents your DNS queries from leaking outside the VPN tunnel.


This stops your ISP or any third party from seeing what websites you visit.


✅ Kill Switch

If the VPN connection drops, the kill switch cuts your internet access immediately, preventing any data from leaking unprotected.


✅ Split Tunneling

Allows you to choose which apps or sites use the VPN and which don't.



Example: Your browser goes through the VPN, but Spotify uses your normal internet.



🧠 In Simple Terms:

VPN encryption locks your internet traffic in a secure vault and sends it through a private tunnel. Meanwhile, privacy features ensure no one can track what you do, where you're browsing from, or intercept your sensitive information.
