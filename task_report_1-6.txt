1. Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up.


I selected Proton VPN as my VPN service. It is a reputable, privacy-focused VPN provider developed by the makers of ProtonMail. It is known for:


Its strict no-log policy


Availability of a free plan


Transparent Swiss jurisdiction (strong privacy laws)


Open-source applications


I signed up using my email address through the official website https://protonvpn.com. No credit card was required for the free plan.



2. Download and install the VPN client.

I downloaded the official Proton VPN desktop client for Windows from their website to ensure authenticity and safety.

Installation steps included:


Launching the installer


Granting permission


Logging in with my Proton credentials


Once installed, the Proton VPN interface opened with access to a list of global VPN servers.



3. Connect to a VPN server (choose closest or any location).


From the Proton VPN client:


I connected to the Poland Free Server #13 (PL-FREE#13).


The connection was successful and confirmed by:


A green "Connected" status


Real-time upload/download graphs


Server info including IP, uptime, and speed


Although Japan isn’t the closest, I selected it to test international routing and privacy.



4. Verify your IP address has changed (use whatismyipaddress.com).


Before VPN:


My IP was from India  103.177.174.127, based on my real ISP.


After connecting to Proton VPN:


I visited https://whatismyipaddress.com


My new IP was shown as 149.102.244.113


Location: Warsaw, Mazowieckie, Poland


ISP: DataCamp Limited


Hostname: PL-free-13.protonvpn.net



✅ This confirms my IP address changed, and my real location was successfully masked.




5. Browse a website to confirm traffic is encrypted.



While still connected to the VPN:


I opened https://www.wikipedia.org


In the browser (Google Chrome), I clicked the lock icon in the address bar


Certificate and encryption details showed:


HTTPS active (secure)


TLS version: TLS 1.3


Issued by: GlobalSign



✅ This confirms traffic was encrypted end-to-end using a secure HTTPS connection.



6. Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP.



After completing the above steps, I disconnected Proton VPN.


✅ IP Comparison:


Before: India IP 103.177.174.127


During VPN: Japan IP 149.102.244.113


After disconnect: My Indian IP returned



✅ Speed Comparison:


While connected to the VPN (Poland server), browsing speed slightly decreased due to:


Geographic distance


Free server congestion


Before connecting VPN - download speed in Mbps - 93.52 with upload speed 69.38 Mbps.


After connecting VPN - download speed in Mbps - 80.05 with upload speed 68.09 Mbps.


After disconnecting, browsing speed improved and websites loaded faster. This performance impact is expected when using free VPNs due to bandwidth limits.
